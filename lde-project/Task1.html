          My Turnitin similarity score was <b>10%</b>. I consider this a good result, as it indicates that most of the work is my own opinion. This low percentage is likely due to the correct use of citations and active paraphrasing of sources in IEEE style. To improve this in the future (or to maintain this level), I will continue to carefully paraphrase ideas rather than copy-pasting, and I will always check that each source is properly cited. I will also ensure that any overlaps are only technical elements, such as titles or common phrases.
