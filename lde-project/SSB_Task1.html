        <p>The modern market offers a multitude of solutions for creating online stores. Most of them fall into the category of SaaS (Software as a Service) — platforms that provide hosting, software, and technical support for a monthly fee. Let's examine two key players in this segment: Shopify and BigCommerce.</p>

        <button class="collapse-btn">−</button>
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>Shopify is the most popular SaaS platform, dominating due to its exceptional simplicity and focus on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) as well as brands selling directly to consumers (D2C).</p>

        <button class="collapse-btn">−</button>
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>BigCommerce positions itself as a more flexible solution aimed at fast-growing businesses and the B2B (business-to-business) segment. Its main advantage is more built-in features without the need for apps.</p>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Powerful built-in functionality:</strong> Many of the things Shopify requires apps to do (like extended product variants, complex discounts, customer groups for B2B) are built in out of the box.</td>
                        <td><strong>Learning curve:</strong> The platform is considered more difficult for beginners than Shopify due to its greater number of features.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>SEO flexibility:</strong> Gives you full control over your URL structure, which is a plus for search engine optimization.</td>

      <div class="card-content">
        <p>Shopify is a great choice for beginners and D2C brands that value simplicity and speed of launch above all else. BigCommerce is a better choice for established businesses, companies with complex catalogues, and B2B that want to avoid transaction fees.</p>
