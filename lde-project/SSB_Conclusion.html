            <p>This portfolio successfully demonstrates the necessary knowledge and practical skills to apply modern software solutions to improve business operations, which meet the Level 4 Learning Outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Key Achievements and Compliance with Assessment Criteria</h3>

            <h4>1. Knowledge and Understanding (Criterion 2)</h4>
            <p>The portfolio provides accurate and detailed knowledge of the basic concepts and principles of key business software. This includes a comprehensive analysis of the four core office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access) with a clear delineation of their main functions, benefits and inherent limitations. Analysis of communication tools (Microsoft Teams) and collaboration tools (Microsoft OneDrive) further demonstrates a deep understanding of how modern software supports business continuity and knowledge management in a hybrid environment.</p>

            <h4>2. Practical Application Skills (Criterion 4)</h4>
            <p>The work contains strong evidence of practical implementation, fulfilling the core requirement of applying concepts in real-world settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mail Merge and Pivot Tables:</strong> Hands-on testing of the Mail Merge feature in Word/Excel and creating a Pivot Table in Excel successfully demonstrates the use of these tools to automate routine administrative tasks and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Documented screenshots of instant chat (Teams) and co-editing (OneDrive) provide clear proof of concept for streamlining communication flow and eliminating version conflicts in document management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Cognitive and Intellectual Skills (Criterion 3)</h4>
            <p>The submitted work is not purely descriptive; It demonstrates analytical thinking by justifying the use and limitations of each tool:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The analysis compares Shopify and BigCommerce, weighing their strengths (e.g., zero transaction fees vs. ease of use) and weaknesses (e.g., sales volume limits vs. the cost of add-ons).</li>
                <li>The discussion of mind maps clearly assesses their usefulness as a tool for increasing creativity and optimising project planning, drawing on academic research for justification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Transferable Skills and Citations (Criteria 1 and 5)</h4>
            <p>The portfolio is professionally formatted, with logical consistency, clear headings, and complete content. IEEE citation style must be used consistently throughout the document, ensuring academic integrity and giving proper credit to the sources used.</p>

            <hr class="divider">

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In summary, this portfolio successfully meets all the criteria of the “Software Solutions for Business” module, demonstrating both theoretical knowledge and the necessary practical competence to effectively use digital tools in the modern workplace.</p>
